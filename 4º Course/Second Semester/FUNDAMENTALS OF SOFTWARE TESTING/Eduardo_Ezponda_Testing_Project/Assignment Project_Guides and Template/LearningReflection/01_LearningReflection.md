## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?

- My experience testing the given webapp was fruitful. I had already used GitLab before, so I knew the platform and it was easier for me to test it. I also have experience with unit testing, so this task helped me to keep learning and see things more from the platform side, not just from the code side.

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.

- First, I read the instructions to understand what I had to do. Then I looked at the test case template and the example of the login test. After that, I followed each step on the GitLab platform and wrote down what actions I needed to do in the test case. I added the steps one by one and included the right variables while testing the webapp.

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 

 - I don’t have much experience with other tools, but I think using tools like TestRail or Jira could help manage test cases better, especially for bigger projects. They make it easier to organize and track the progress of testing. For this project, using a clear template and writing step-by-step tests was also a good and simple style to follow.

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?

- I used Visual Studio Code because it is widely used in the industry. I also feel comfortable with it since I have experience and good knowledge of how it works. It makes editing files easier and faster for me.
     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?

- I didn’t find big problems. The only small doubts I had were about how to write variables like groupname or username in the URLs, and how to write some custom messages. But everything was very well explained. The templates and examples helped me a lot to understand the steps and solve any confusion.

## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?

- I didn’t find any trouble using GitHub. I have been using it for several years during my university degree for all my projects. Also, I used GitHub during my internship in a company, so I know the platform well.

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )

- I have never done automated testing before, but I did some research. For these exact test cases, I think Selenium could be a good choice. It works well for browser-based tests and supports actions like clicking buttons, filling forms, and checking text—just like we did in the GitLab tests. Also, it supports many programming languages, so it gives flexibility in the future.

## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing

- Automation testers need Selenium, Playwright, or Cypress for UI, Appium for mobile, and Postman for APIs. Must know Java/Python/JS, CI/CD (Jenkins, Docker), and Agile. JMeter, security testing, and AI tools. Soft skills matter too.

## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?

- To grow in Software Testing, I need to learn more automation (like Selenium or Playwright), API testing (Postman), and CI/CD basics. I should also improve my coding (Java/Python) and soft skills like communication and teamwork.

## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 

- This project really helped me put my theoretical knowledge into practice. Writing manual test cases step by step made me think like a real QA tester, not just about code. The clear templates and examples guided me well.

I especially liked testing the full user flow on GitLab—from registration to project and issue management. It showed me how important good documentation and consistent steps are when working with a team.

For improvement, it might help to add more real-world scenarios, such as testing integrations (webhooks, APIs) or performance checks. Also, a short module on basic automation tools would be a great next step to bridge manual and automated testing skills. Overall, the content was clear and very useful for learning.
