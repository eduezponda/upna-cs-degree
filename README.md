**Bachelor's Degree in International Computer Engineering**
**Overview**

This repository includes all my academic work separated by subjects from my Bachelor's degree in International Computer Engineering at the Public University of Navarra (2021-2025). The coursework spans from foundational programming concepts to advanced data structures, mathematics, and physics.
Year 1

The first year mainly focuses on the basics of programming with a significant component of mathematics and physics.

**Subjects**

    Mathematics I
    Informatics
    Business
    Physics
    Discrete Mathematics and Logic
    Statistics
    Data Structures
    Programming
    Mathematics II
    Fundamentals of Electronics

**Informatics**
In this subject, we learned basic Python, acquiring concepts of great importance for the future. Emphasis was placed on understanding the use of variable types, control structures, and matrix drawings.

**Programming**
We studied the C language to understand how everything works at the most basic level, focusing primarily on program derivation.

**Data Structures**
In the second semester, we gained more knowledge by incorporating pointers, stacks, tables, queues, recursion, and other data structures.

**Year 2**

The second year expands on the foundational knowledge, introducing more advanced topics and practical applications.

**Subjects**

    Algorithmics
    Databases I
    Operating Systems
    Software Engineering
    Computer Structure
    Advanced Programming
    Databases II
    Artificial Intelligence
    Computer Architecture and Organization
    Computer Networks

**Algorithmics**
Implemented algorithms such as Wilson's algorithm with an emphasis on problem analysis, data handling, data acquisition, and possible conclusions.

**Databases I**
Learned the basic fundamentals of SQL queries.

**Operating Systems**
Studied the basics of operating systems, creating shells, schedulers, and concurrent systems with an emphasis on using threads and semaphores.

**Computer Structure**
Learned the basic inner workings of computers.

**Software Engineering**
Introduced to Java as an object-oriented language, learned to analyze exercises and use diagrams (class diagrams, sequence diagrams, etc.).

**Computer Architecture and Organization**
Advanced knowledge of how PCs function internally.

**Databases II**
Advanced SQL queries, including the use of triggers, synonyms, sequences, and multi-table joins.

**Artificial Intelligence**
Implemented various algorithms mainly using trees and graphs to solve complex exercises (neural networks, Bayesian networks, etc.).

**Advanced Programming**
Expanded Java knowledge to include client-server models, graphical interfaces, events, serialization, multithreading, parallelism, exceptions, collections, and more. Combined all knowledge in a project called RoscoBotones, a version of the game "Pasapalabra."

**Computer Networks**
Learned to use socket groups with poll in C, handling multiple clients, and using message protocols. All knowledge was combined in a final project based on the game Tic-Tac-Toe, with a limit of three simultaneous games, including a single-player mode against an AI.

**Year 3**

The third year builds upon the previous years, introducing more complex concepts and real-world applications.

**Subjects**

    Software Analysis and Design
    Knowledge Engineering
    Network Architecture
    Business Application Analysis
    Secure Programming
    Software Architecture
    Computation
    Web Information Systems
    Software Verification and Validation
    Web Engineering

**Software Analysis and Design**

Covered Excel, diagrams, process models, Docker (Dockerfile, Docker Compose, MySQL), data processing through CSV obtained from a URL, database design in a star schema, and basics of Grafana and Power BI. Task 5 involves implementing everything, analyzing the data obtained in explicacionResultados.pdf, and explaining the data acquisition process in procesoCargaDatos.pdf. Covered various software diagrams for analyzing complex problems, including class diagrams, component diagrams, use case diagrams, activity diagrams, sequence diagrams, state diagrams, and entity-relationship diagrams.

**Knowledge Engineering**
Implemented algorithms such as PCA, fuzzy classification, fuzzy logic, linguistic labels, decision making, and fuzzy classification using MATLAB.

**Network Architecture**
Implemented the use of networks, routers, interfaces, IP management, handling Ethernet cables with switches and ports.

**Secure Programming**
Introduced secure Java programming concepts including SQL injection, data encryption, patterns, prepared statements, loggers, policies, containers, public and private key cryptography, and CTFs in WebGoat.

**Software Architecture**
Implemented a final project in Android Studio simulating a rehabilitation machine, covering RestServer, Back4App, interfaces, graphical elements, events, photo taking, and graphing.

**Computation**
Implemented error handling, theorems for finding roots in functions and polynomials, separating them into intervals (SCRUM), genetic algorithms with various methods, interpreting results based on parameters and methods, convergence, fitness functions, gravitational algorithms, and linear systems. Practically implemented in Python a genetic algorithm for the traveling salesman problem, with documentation in I5_EzpondaIgea.pdf and code in C5_EzpondaIgea.zip.

**Web Engineering**
Covered HTML, CSS, JS, React, accessibility, usability, SEO, Figma, and Git, culminating in a web page project based on a books API in React in the grupo-jamon repository.

**Web Information Systems**
Covered backend development using PHP to implement a recipes API, including AJAX, MVC, and fetch, to combine PHP within HTML.

**Software Verification and Validation**
Implemented best coding practices such as clean code, use of Git, Laravel, Docker, unit and integration testing (dummies, fakes, spies, mocks, stubs), error and exception handling, Postman, CI/CD, GrumPHP, GitHub Actions (CodeSniffer, Mess Detector). Also performed coding katas. All is documented in the final project ges03_laravel, a Twitch API in Laravel covered by test doubles, multiple endpoints, and best coding practices. Everything is in PHP. The name ges03 comes from the initials (Guillermo, Eduardo, Santiago) and the birth year 2003.
